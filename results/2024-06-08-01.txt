Enter query: how to protect equipment from ESD?
Running chain...
Time elapsed: 3.32 s
Wear a grounded wrist strap against your skin to eliminate static on your body. Prevent the part from touching your clothing, as most clothing is insulative and retains a charge even when you are wearing a wrist strap. Use the black side of a grounded work mat to provide a static-free work surface. Select a grounding system, such as attaching the ESD ground clip to any frame ground, ground braid, or green-wire ground, to provide protection that meets the specific service requirement.
